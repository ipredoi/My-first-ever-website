            <p>Hi, I am Ionut and I am an Automotive Engineer and SoC student.</p>
            <p>I am originally from Bucharest, Romania and now I live in Coventry, United Kingdom.</p>
            <p>I moved here three years ago, when I started to work as a Design Engineer for Jaguar Land Rover, the biggest car manufacturer in the UK. </p>
            <p>Since childhood, I have been attracted to cars, how things work and video games.</p>
            <p>At the age of 7, I got my first video game console, an Ending-Man Terminator which was a Nintendo clone sold in Eastern Europe.
            <p>A few years later, my parents bought me my first computer, a very heavy Windows 98 IBM, which opened my world to technology, computer games and the Internet.</p>
            <p>During high school, I didn’t find computer programming very attractive and in 2013 I graduated Automotive Engineering at <a href="https://upb.ro" alt="UPB" target="_blank">University Politehnica of Bucharest</a>. In 2017 I obtained my Master’s Diploma in Automotive Engineering after 3 years of splitting between a full-time job, courses, seminars, laboratories, projects, family and friends.</p>
            <p>In 2013 I started my first full-time job as a Service Advisor in a Mercedes-Benz workshop.</p>
            <p>In 2014 I left my service advisor job and I started to work as a Mechanical Engineer for <a href="https://group.renault.com/en/our-company/our-brands/" alt="Group Renault-Nissan" target="_blank"> Group Renault-Nissan </a> . After more than three fulfilling years, I took a step forward and followed my dream to work as a Design Engineer for <a href="https://www.jaguarlandrover.com/" alt="Jaguar Land Rover" target="_blank">Jaguar Land Rover</a>.</p>
            <p>Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, after three years full of accomplishments and challenges, my journey with JLR came to an end and now, I am very excited to start my journey into tech as a 
                <a href="https://www.schoolofcode.com/" alt="School of Code" target="_blank"> School of Code </a> student.</p>
